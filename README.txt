Simple program for applying cuts to results from
DELPHES, with input in the form of a .root file.

Install: With ROOT configured and ‘source /path/to/thisroot.sh’
	  executed (preferably put it in your .bash_profile) you
	  should be able to just type ‘make’.
	  To uninstall do ‘make clean’.

Usage: ./ROOTCut /path/to/rootfile.root

There we go. This will probably never get beyond a simple, specific
tool for my own analyses, but hey, I can dream of it one day
evolving into a beautiful iPad app for general cut-performing on
the move. Winner winner, chicken dinner.
